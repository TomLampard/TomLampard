Welcome to my profile. 
I'm currently working on a few different things, 
but generally I'm either working in Cinema4d creating 3d assets/models/environments, 
building a sweet keeb, 
or developing web-apps, Sites and my skills in react/nextjs. 

I'm up for collaboration, small project, big project....there is always something to be learned, 
if you think there is some value I can add...i'm in :). 

Please feel free to contact me.
